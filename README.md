# Boards

Helps you display vector graphics for various [hang|finger]boards out in the wild in a flutter project (if interest for non flutter then let me know).

Contains:

  * SVG
  * hold / edge depth mappings
  * flutter example


See a sample [here](https://gitaaron.github.io/boards/#/).

Impetus for this project was in support of the campus sequence feature in [hangbird](https://hangbird.app).

Thanks to Demir for providing ballsy board info.
